- 👋 Hi, I’m Achala Rao

About me:
🎓 Masters Graduate from Syracuse University with a focus on Business Analytics.
💼 Former Data Analyst at Women Leaders in Data and AI.
🌍 Analyzed the hidden frequency of earthquakes in a recent data project (turns out they happen way more often than you'd think).
🌟 Always on the lookout for stories hidden within data.
🎨 When I’m not analyzing, you’ll find me painting or lost in a good book.
